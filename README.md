# Twitter, but unbiased 
> Twitter but clearer, for you

Twitter is littered with opinions from all political sides but it can be extremely tiring to get tweets about a topic from sides to get an overall picture. That's where we come in. Enter a search term like #CapitolRiots or #Biden46 and our trusty NLP model will return a couple lists of segregated tweets about the topic.

Feel free to use our attribute search and get the most popular tweets, tweets from verified accounts, or in a specific date range.

See a tweet and wanna see what side it belongs to? Or maybe a tweet has a hashtag that you'd like to use the website for? No need to bookmark our website, simply @Unbiased_bot in the replies and the bot will get back to you with an answer and a direct link to the website with the hashtag.
